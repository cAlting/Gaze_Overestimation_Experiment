# Using the experiment

__Make your own image files (stimuli) work__:  
This experiment uses different looker with different gaze deviations. The naming convention for the stimuli (images) is `<looker gender><looker id/index>_<gaze deviation>.jpg` (i.e. `M01_00.jpg` for a male looker with id 01 and a gaze deviation of 00Â° relative to a straight line of sight). Please follow this convention to make your own files compatible with this experiment and the preprocessing notebook provided under code.
