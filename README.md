# Description

This is the GitHub repository for the master thesis "In the eye of the beholder: Determinants of overestimation of gaze directions", supervised by Prof. Dr. Gernot Horstmann and Linda Linke (MSc) of the deparment AE01 Neurocognitive Psychology at Bielefeld University.

Overall, this work addresses the question whether measures of external eye morphology of looking individuals ("lookers", L) can explain the overestimation of gaze direction by observers ("observers", O) described e.g. by Anstis et al. (1969), West (2011), Loth et al. (2018). Previous experiments found either overestimation, underestimation, or both overestimation and underestimation in one experiment. In addition to differences in the setups of the experiments, one factor has not been investigated before: Measures of the eyes of the subjects serving as lookers. In studies that used different lookers (e.g., Moors et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2011), there is evidence that results and effects found may depend on the individuals used, if applicable.

Therefore, in a first experiment, photographs were taken of 43 subjects whose heads were pointed straight at the camera. Each person looked at one of 13 gaze targets (0° to 13.3° deviation from the line of direct regard in 1.1° steps, one target per image). For the images with centrally aligned gaze, the most common measures in the literature to describe external eye morphology (WHR, SSI, SSR, HEI, HC, RIL; see Caspar et al., 2021; Danel et al., 2020, 2023; Kobayashi & Kohshima, 1997, 2001; Kano et al., 2021; Perea García et al., 2017; Perea-García et al., 2019) were determined using FIJI software (ImageJ).

__Make your own image files (stimuli) work__:  
This experiment uses different looker with different gaze deviations. The naming convention for the stimuli (images) is `<looker gender><looker id/index>_<gaze deviation>.jpg` (i.e. `M01_00.jpg` for a male looker with id 01 and a gaze deviation of 00° relative to a straight line of sight). Please follow this convention to make your own files compatible with this experiment and the preprocessing notebook provided under code.
