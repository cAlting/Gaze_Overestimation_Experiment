# Short Description
Experiment to investigate the influence effect of different eye shape parameter on the overestimation effect observed during jugdments of another persons's gaze directions.

_The stimuli/Image files are NOT included (privacy)_

_detailed description wip_ For now refer to the code comments in the provided jupyter notebook `Preprocessing_Pipeline.ipynb`.

# Using the experiment

_How to make it work_:
This experiment uses different looker with different gaze deviations (relative to straight line of sight).  The naming convention for the stimuli (images) is `<looker gender><looker id/index>_<gaze deviation>.jpg` (i.e. M01_00.jpg for a male looker with id 01 and a gaze deviation of 00Â° relative to a straight line of sight). Please follow this convention to guarantee out of the box compatibility of your own images/stimuli with this experiment and the preprocessing notebook provided under code.
