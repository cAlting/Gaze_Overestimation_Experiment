# Short Description
Experiment to investigate the influence effect of different eye shape parameter on the overestimation effect observed during jugdments of another persons's gaze directions. The procedure is based on the one reported by [Anstis, Mayhew, & Morley (1969) The perception of where a face or television "portrait" is looking](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1970-11652-001).

_The stimuli/Image files are NOT included (privacy)_

# Using the experiment

_How to make it work_:
This experiment uses different looker with different gaze deviations (relative to straight line of sight).  The naming convention for the stimuli (images) is `<looker gender><looker id/index>_<gaze deviation>.jpg` (i.e. M01_00.jpg for a male looker with id 01 and a gaze deviation of 00Â° relative to a straight line of sight). Please follow this convention to guarantee out of the box compatibility of your own images/stimuli with this experiment and the preprocessing notebook provided under code.
